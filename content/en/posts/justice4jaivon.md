Greetings,

I'm Reverend Mat Thomas, pastor of  the Bethel Church of the Nazarene  in the Germantown section of Quincy, Massachusetts.  I also co-lead a few different activist organizations in Quincy (Quincy 4 Justice and Quincy for Transformative Change).

I'm calling on all of you reading this to support an 18 year old Quincy High School Junior named Jaivon Harris.

Jaivon is the oldest of 4 and his parents could not be more proud of the young man he is. He’s played football for the Dorchester Eagles,  Lacrosse for Metro, and basketball for a community team.  Jaivon was studying tradelines in finance with the goal of being an entrepreneur who brings positive change to his own community.  He's a young man who believes in the idea of “each one, teach one.”

Jaivon is currently falsely accused of and currently detained unjustly for a crime that he did not commit.  We know all too well that systemic racism allows Black boys in this country to criminalized and harshly punished for no reason.

How can you help?  We need you to do 3 Things.  All 3 of these things a crucial for there to be true change for Jaivon and our community.

1\.  [Please donate what you can](https://givebutter.com/justice4jaivon).  Money will be used to support his legal defense.   We need to secure legal counsel as soon as possible and we have only 2 weeks to raise the funds to pay for it.

2\.  Share this flyer through text and Facebook, Instagram and all of your social media with the hashtag #justice4jaivon

3\.  Pray for transformation of our systems and our community and act as if those prayers are real.   Join the community defense team to support the family and other people like Jaivon who are unjustly detained.
