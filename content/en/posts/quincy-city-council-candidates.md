Election Day, November 2nd 2021, is coming up soon! Don’t panic – we know it’s difficult, time-consuming, and often overwhelming for every individual voter to comb through all of the information available, trying to pick out important factors to help determine which candidate to vote for. To assist with that, the QFTC organizers have researched every city council candidate in a contested race this year, and compiled lists of positive progressive factors (“green flags”, as well as less progressive “mixed” or anti-progressive “red” flags if applicable) based on publicly available information - see the “Sources” section below for a full list of citations. We hope that this will help Quincy voters make their best and most informed decisions!
