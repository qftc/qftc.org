The School Committee has 3 seats up for election with 7 candidates. Because the ballot cannot have more than 6 candidates for those 3 seats, the Preliminary City Election will narrow the field down, and one of the candidates will be eliminated from the November ballot. If there is a candidate you want to see on the November ballot, it’s important to vote in the Preliminary City Election on or before 9/14.

**Strategic Voting**

On the Preliminary City Election ballot, you will be able to choose up to two candidates per seat. This means that you will be able to choose up to 6 names for the school committee a. However, you do not need to use all your votes!

A good strategy to use in the Preliminary City Election to help get a candidate on the ballot in the City Election is to vote for just those candidates that you strongly support. By doing this, other candidates you might have voted for get one less vote, and you strengthen your preferred candidates’ chances for getting on the final ballot.

You can even vote for just one candidate if there’s just one you strongly support, especially if you support a candidate who is not an incumbent and who would benefit from strategic voting.
