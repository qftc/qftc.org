**On August 19, QFTC held a virtual forum with six of the candidates running for Quincy school committee seats, to ask them about how they intend to effect change within the policy making body of the QPS school committee. (Ellen O'Donnell was unfortunately not able to attend.) The questions were submitted by QFTC organizers and the Education Task Force.**

We hope this additional information helps you all decide which candidate(s) you would like to vote for in the upcoming elections!
