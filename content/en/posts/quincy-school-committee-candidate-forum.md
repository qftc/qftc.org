The Quincy school committee has three seats up for election, and seven candidates seeking to fill them: incumbents Emily Lebo, Doug Gutro,and Courtney Perdios, and challengers Liz Speakman, Liberty Scaaf, Ellen O'Donnell and Tina Cahill. There will be a primary election on Sept 14 to pare the field down to six, and then a general election on Nov 2.

On August 19, QFTC held a virtual forum with six of the candidates running for Quincy school committee seats, to ask them about how they intend to effect change within the policy making body of the QPS school committee. (Ellen O'Donnell was unfortunately not able to attend.) The questions were submitted by QFTC organizers and the Education Task Force. 

The recording for the forum can be watched here: [https://go.qftc.org/schoolcommitteeforum](https://go.qftc.org/schoolcommitteeforum "https://go.qftc.org/schoolcommitteeforum")

We hope this additional information helps you all decide which candidate(s) you would like to vote for in the upcoming elections!
