On November 5, 2021, the Quincy Public School administration announced their finding that North Quincy and Quincy High School students had been sharing video and audio files on social media that contained sexual harassment and hate speech ([citation](https://www.quincypublicschools.com/kindergarten_registration_for_2020-21/11_5_2021_message_from_superintendent_mulvey "https://www.quincypublicschools.com/kindergarten_registration_for_2020-21/11_5_2021_message_from_superintendent_mulvey")). On Nov. 9, a video created by Quincy High School students that contained extreme anti-Black racist hate speech came to light as well ([citation](https://www.quincypublicschools.com/cms/One.aspx?portalId=22782402&pageId=50065059 "https://www.quincypublicschools.com/cms/One.aspx?portalId=22782402&pageId=50065059")). Hundreds of Quincy High School students walked out in protest on Nov. 12, joined by numerous North Quincy High School students as well (citation [here ](https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/quincy-high-to-hold-meeting-after-students-fight-over-racist-video/2564846/  "https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/quincy-high-to-hold-meeting-after-students-fight-over-racist-video/2564846/ ")and [here](https://www.patriotledger.com/story/news/2021/11/12/students-walk-out-quincy-high-protesting-racism-hate-speech/8584489002/ "https://www.patriotledger.com/story/news/2021/11/12/students-walk-out-quincy-high-protesting-racism-hate-speech/8584489002/")).

The difference in the school administration's responses to these two incidents is striking. For the first incident, the administration made a strong statement that "this offensive and dangerous behavior will not be tolerated" ([citation](https://www.quincypublicschools.com/kindergarten_registration_for_2020-21/11_5_2021_message_from_superintendent_mulvey "https://www.quincypublicschools.com/kindergarten_registration_for_2020-21/11_5_2021_message_from_superintendent_mulvey")). For the second, their insipid statement reads, "there are clearly issues with culture and climate that require collaboration with outside resources and strategic planning in order to move forward with reinforcing our schools as safe and supportive environments." ([citation](https://www.quincypublicschools.com/cms/One.aspx?portalId=22782402&pageId=50065059 "https://www.quincypublicschools.com/cms/One.aspx?portalId=22782402&pageId=50065059"))

Since early 2021, Doug Gutro and Emily Lebo on the school committee have spearheaded an effort to bring in programs run by DOVE Inc (Domestic Violence Ended) to address issues of sexual harassment, assault, and dating abuse in schools ([citation](https://www.quincypublicschools.com/school_committee/agendas_and_minutes/2020-2021/4-7-2021_school_committee_meeting "https://www.quincypublicschools.com/school_committee/agendas_and_minutes/2020-2021/4-7-2021_school_committee_meeting")). Thus, a concrete and targeted response was readily available to offer as a way to address the first incident. However, no such initiative exists to address racism in the Quincy school system. For the second incident, the only solution that the administration had to offer was community forums from Walker Therapeutic and vague "ongoing work" involving "community building, health education and interventions, and peer mentoring" ([citation](https://www.quincypublicschools.com/cms/One.aspx?portalId=22782402&pageId=50065059 "https://www.quincypublicschools.com/cms/One.aspx?portalId=22782402&pageId=50065059")).

The absence of a specific program with a clear goal to remedy racism amongst Quincy students and in the Quincy school environment is not at all surprising. The nearest thing to such a program was implemented in 2016, when the school hired consultants from Visions Inc for a "Diversity Competency Initiative" which was meant to "provide our students and staff with the tools needed to thrive in a diverse world" with "race, class, gender, and other differences" ([citation](https://p19cdn4static.sharpschool.com/UserFiles/Servers/Server_22782318/File/School%20Committee/Agendas%20and%20Minutes/2016-2017/10.5.16-School-Committee-Notes.pdf "https://p19cdn4static.sharpschool.com/UserFiles/Servers/Server_22782318/File/School%20Committee/Agendas%20and%20Minutes/2016-2017/10.5.16-School-Committee-Notes.pdf")). The failure of this initiative to adequately address the issue of racism can be seen quite clearly in the student Instagram pages ["POC At North Quincy"](https://www.instagram.com/pocatnorthquincy/?hl=en "https://www.instagram.com/pocatnorthquincy/?hl=en") and ["Black At Quincy High"](https://www.instagram.com/blackatquincyhigh/?hl=en "https://www.instagram.com/blackatquincyhigh/?hl=en") created in 2020 (citations [here](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/07/02/metro/quincy-students-color-are-frustrated-by-inaction-racial-harassment-now-theyre-speaking-out-instagram/  "https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/07/02/metro/quincy-students-color-are-frustrated-by-inaction-racial-harassment-now-theyre-speaking-out-instagram/ ") and [here](https://www.patriotledger.com/story/news/local/2020/07/14/black-at-instagram-accounts-tell-stories-of-being-black-at-south-shore-schools/42568093/ "https://www.patriotledger.com/story/news/local/2020/07/14/black-at-instagram-accounts-tell-stories-of-being-black-at-south-shore-schools/42568093/")).

The long-term and institutional nature of the administration's inability to reckon with racism in schools, as well as the way it reflects the regressive nature of a large portion of Quincy's local community, is amply illustrated in the issue of the former North Quincy High School mascot. This mascot, Yakoo, depicted Armenian dentist and North Quincy High alumnus Dr. Allan Yacubian in "redface" caricature. The administration has fielded criticism of the racist nature of the mascot and calls to change it since the 1980s. The school was asked to remove the mascot in 1990 by the US Department of Education, but the school committee voted to keep it in 1993. In 1995, the Boston office of the Federal Civil Rights Office ruled the mascot "offensive". ([citation](https://p19cdn4static.sharpschool.com/UserFiles/Servers/Server_22782318/File/School%20Committee/Agendas%20and%20Minutes/2017-2018/12.6.17-School-Committee-Notes.pdf "https://p19cdn4static.sharpschool.com/UserFiles/Servers/Server_22782318/File/School%20Committee/Agendas%20and%20Minutes/2017-2018/12.6.17-School-Committee-Notes.pdf")) And yet, it wasn't until 2020, amidst a renewed push to demand justice for marginalized races, that the mascot was updated to remove its harmful depiction of Native American stereotypes ([citation](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/08/04/metro/mayor-unveils-revised-mascot-north-quincy-high/ "https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/08/04/metro/mayor-unveils-revised-mascot-north-quincy-high/")). Even then, there was significant community pushback against the proposed change ([citation](https://www.patriotledger.com/story/news/local/2020/07/01/calls-to-change-north-quincys-yakoo-mascot-pick-up-steam-again/113922720/ "https://www.patriotledger.com/story/news/local/2020/07/01/calls-to-change-north-quincys-yakoo-mascot-pick-up-steam-again/113922720/")).

Regarding the hate speech incidents in the past week, the school administration will be holding another community forum for parents and guardians on Nov. 15 (Monday) at 5 pm in Quincy High School Auditorium ([citation](https://www.quincypublicschools.com/kindergarten_registration_for_2020-21/11_12_2021_message_from_superintendent_mulvey "https://www.quincypublicschools.com/kindergarten_registration_for_2020-21/11_12_2021_message_from_superintendent_mulvey")). We urge everyone - whether you have children in the Quincy public school system or not - to show solidarity and support for the students who are leading the way in creating a more just and inclusive Quincy. \[I probably need one more sentence for inspiration/motivation and as a bridge to the CTAs\]

\[insert calls to action here: show up outside the meeting? Write and call the admins?\]
