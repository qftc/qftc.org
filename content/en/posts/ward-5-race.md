##### Miscellaneous:

* Says that he would not accept donations from developers or contractors whose projects were being voted on directly by city council

### **Mixed Flag**

* Stated his support for the ordinance to establish the Department of Social Justice and Equity on record in Ordinance Committee meeting in 2020; however, seems to be under the impression that the proposed department was merely about exclusionary zoning, and could not recall the department’s name in interviews in 2021
