Stop by Quincy High School any time between 2pm-4pm on Sunday, December 19th to support our BIPOC Quincy High students who continually encounter discrimination, racism, and dehumanization. We will be chalking messages of hope, love, inclusion, and racial justice, on the sidewalks surrounding the school to offer words of encouragement to our students.
