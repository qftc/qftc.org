Election Day, November 2nd 2021, is coming up soon! Don’t panic – we know it’s difficult, time-consuming, and often overwhelming for every individual voter to comb through all of the information available, trying to pick out important factors to help determine which candidate to vote for. To assist with that, the QFTC organizers have researched every city council and school committee candidate in a contested race this year, and compiled lists of positive progressive factors (“green flags”) as well as potentially less progressive “mixed” or anti-progressive “red” flags if applicable. We hope that this will help Quincy voters make their best and most informed decisions!
